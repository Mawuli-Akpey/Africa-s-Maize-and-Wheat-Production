# Maize and Wheat Production in Africa

## Dataset
This dataset  consists of information on the Gross Production Index of different
agricultural produce for individual countries, regions and the world as a whole.
This dataset can be found in FAO's repository of food statistics.

## Summary of Findings

In this exploration, we found out that maize production in Africa had a slightly
steeper growth than global maize production indicating a more positive growth from
2001 to 2020. The highest percentage rate change occured from 2016 to 2017 for maize
production in Africa. Further investigations tells us that Southern Africa's almost
1% increase in GPI was responsible for that particular sudden jump in GPI by the
African continent. However 2018 recorded a significant dip with Southern Africa 
losing its grip along with a significant drop from the Northern Africa region resulting
in the entire drop for the African region. Western, Easterna and Middle Africa had a 
relatively stable positive growth in terms of GPI for maize production. Africa's maize
production ended with a higher GPI to global maize GPI.

Wheat on the other hand displayed a slightly different story with the total global GPI 
being higher than Africa's by the end of the period under study. Africa's production of
wheat saw significant year on year fluctuations attributing to the high difference in GPI
ranges. Western Africa saw the fastest growth from 2001 to 2011


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on how each African sub-region has contributed to the 
maize and wheat production as a fraction of Africa's total production from 2001 to 2020.
I start by comparing the trend of Africa's production GPI to that of global GPI for both
maize and wheat across the same time period.

Then I focus on the influence of the five different sub-regions on the total production 
of wheat and maize by plotting each trends in one single plot. I wil then look at the 
percentage contribution of region at a five year interval for both maize and wheat
starting from 2001, 2010, and 2020. This would describe how much each regions contribution
grew or fell
